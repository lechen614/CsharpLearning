## Setup VS code
Software development is more than just writing code. The process of writing, debugging, testing, updating/versioning, and releasing code is a significant undertaking. That's why need IDE

## Call methods
- Stateful versus stateless methods
    - stateless methods are implemented so that they can work without referencing or changing any values already stored in memory. Stateless methods are also known as **static methods**.
    - stateful methods are built in such a way that they rely on values stored in memory by previous lines of code that have already been executed. Or they modify the state of the application by updating values or storing new values in memory. They're also known as **instance methods**.
    - Stateful (instance) methods keep track of their state in **fields**, which are variables defined on the class. Each new instance of the class gets its own copy of those fields in which to store state.
- `new`: 1. request address large enough to store a new object based on the class 2. It creates the new object and stores it at the memory address 3. It returns the memory address and saved in the object.
- Why `Next()` is stateful: At a high level, computers are good at following specific instructions to create a reliable and repeatable outcome. To create the illusion of randomness, the developers of the Next() method decided to capture the date and time down to the fraction of a millisecond and use that to seed an algorithm that produces a different number each time.

- 'parameter' refers to the variable that's being used inside the method. An 'argument' is the value that's passed when the method is called.
