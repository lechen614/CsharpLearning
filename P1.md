## Write your first C# code
`Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");`
- `Console` is a class
- `WriteLine` is a method within that class. The parentheses are known as the *method invocation operator*, it prints output on the existing line and append a new line after it.
- `Console.Write` method just prints on the existing line.
- A *statement* is a complete instruction in C#, ended by semicolon `;`.

## Store and retrieve data using literal and variable values in C#
### Literals
- 3 types of floating-point literals, default to double, if to use `float` or `decimal` use *literal suffix* `f` and `m`, and it's case insensitive.
- `Console.WriteLine(34.40m)` will print `34.40` because it will keep the scale, while float and double does NOT work this way!
- Boolean literals, key word is `true` and `false`, while `Console.WriteLine(true);` will print `True`.
- `string` for words, phrases, or any alphanumeric data for presentation, not calculation.

### What's a variable?
- A container for storing a type of value.
- A variable name is a human-friendly label that the compiler assigns to a memory address.
- 
### Implicitly typed variable
- `var` keyword tells the compiler to infer the data type of the variable based on the value it is initialized to and MUST be initialized during declaration.

## Perform basic string formatting in C#
### String formatting
- use `\` for escaping, e.g. `\t`, `\n`, `\\` and `\"`.
- Verbatim string literal start with `@`, no longer need to escape like `\`.
- Unicode escape: `\u` plus four-character code, e.g.
```Csharp
// Kon'nichiwa World
Console.WriteLine("\u3053\u3093\u306B\u3061\u306F World!");
```
- Use interpolation expression to combine multiple values into a single literal string.
- You can Combine verbatim literals and string interpolation, and `$` is before `@`. e.g.
```Csharp
string projectName = "First-Project";
Console.WriteLine($@"C:\Output\{projectName}\Data");
```

## Perform basic operations on numbers in C#
- Operation overload of `+`, for string its concatenation, and int its adding up. The compiler infers the proper use based on the data types it's operating on. Consider below example
```Csharp
string firstName = "Bob";
int widgetsSold = 7;

Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + widgetsSold + 7 + " widgets.");
// Output is: "Bob sold 77 widgets."
Console.WriteLine(firstName + " sold " + (widgetsSold + 7) + " widgets.");
// Output is: "Bob sold 14 widgets."
```
- Within parentheses, compiler treats `(widgetsSold + 7)` as two int values and added up, then it will be implicitly converrted to string.
- For the `/` devision operator, type on the left matters(`int`, `decimal`), and if to get decimal number, either or both numbers need to be a decimal type. e.g. `decimal decimalQuotiant = 7 / 5.0m;`
- Casting works as well `(decimal)theIntVariable`
- Order of Operations **PEMDAS** except that there's no exponent operator in C#
    - Parentheses
    - Exponents
    - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
    - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)
- *compound assignment* operators: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `++` and `--`
- increment/decrement order matters.
